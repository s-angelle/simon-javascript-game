This project is a JavaScript "Simon" game that plays out a sequence by activating different colored buttons with corresponding sounds. The user must memorize and accurately recreate the sequence. The game increases in difficulty as the user progresses. This was created as a part of Dr. Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp.
